# README

Welcome to this demo ruby on rails application. It has been designed to demonstrate:

* Well named variables/methods/functions
* Consistent syntax
* Well thought out code
* (At least) basic documentation
* Tests
* Thoughtful commits

## Installation

In order to get this application running using these instructions you will need to be running MacOS and then do perform some additional steps:

1. Be running Ruby 2.7.6
2. Follow some setup commands

### 1. Install Ruby 2.7.6

An easy way to get your mac running ruby 2.7.6 is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

You'll need to use a Terminal to follow the instructions above. Try running the `Terminal` app which is pre-installed on your mac.

Follow the instruction on the [homebrew page](https://brew.sh/) and when that is complete run:

```bash
  brew install ruby@2.7
```

This command will download and install ruby 2.7.6 on your system.

Once complere it will display this message:

> ruby@2.7 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local, because this is an alternate version of another formula.
>
> If you need to have ruby@2.7 first in your PATH, run:
>  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby@2.7/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
>

The rest of these setup instructions assume that you run the command below `If you need to have ruby@2.7 first in your PATH, run:`.

Once you've followed all of these commands it will be a good idea to quit (`CMD+Q`) and then reopen the Terminal application.

### 2. Follow some setup commands

Browse to the directory that this readme file is in in your terminal. You can do this with the `cd` command. For example:

```bash
cd Downloads/olio-rails-example
```

Then run these commands:

```bash
bundle
bundle exec rails db:migrate
bundle exec rails s
```

You should now be able to browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see the application running.


## Areas of interest:

Here are some interesting areas to look at in the application:

### Specs

Have a look in the `specs` directory. Here you'll find tests that ensure the application does what we expect them to.

You can run them with:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

### app/controllers

The `app/controllers` directory is where the rails application recieves a request, i.e. `/articles` and then gets the data needed for that page, and also renders the `view`.

### app/views

Where a controller handles the request, a view contains the code that decides how that request should look. You'll find a mixture of html and ruby code in these files.

### app/models

A model contains the logic for handling data handled by the application. Usually these will talk to a database as is the case for an `ArticleLike`. In this example we also have an `Article` which doesn't talk to the database. It just holds the information about an article which we retrieve from a hosted json file.

### app/services

In rails it's a good idea to try and keep bits of code small so that they're easy to understand. A service often contains some business logic for a specific task that would then be accessed by a controller. Here we have an `ArticlesService` which fetches the list of articles that are hosted in a json file on the server.
